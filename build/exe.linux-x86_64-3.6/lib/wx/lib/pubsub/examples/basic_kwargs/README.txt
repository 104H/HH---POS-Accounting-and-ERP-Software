These two examples demonstrate a simple use of pubsub with the *kwargs*
messaging protocol (default). There are two examples that can be run from
this folder:

**console_main.py**: basic console based, uses the console_senders.py and
    console_listeners.py modules, giving example of the *kwargs*
    messaging protocol.

**wx_main.py**: wxPython GUI application with two windows (win1 and win2)
    that exchange data without any reference to the other. This example
    looks for pubsub on your system path so default install ok.
